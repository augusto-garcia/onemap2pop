### From github

Within R, you need to install and load the package `devtools`:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

This will allow you to automatically build and install packages from
github. If you use Windows, first install
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). On a Mac,
you will need Xcode (available on the App Store). On Linux, you are
good to go.


Then, to install `onemap2pop` from github:

```R
install_github("augusto-garcia/onemap2pop")
```
